# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

# Description
Hello! welcome to My Workday Scheduler where scheduling your 9-5 workday out, booking appointments, etc. just got easier!
This application was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and with the help of our friends, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Javascript, jQuery, and moment.js!
This is my first attempt in coding this project, please feel fee to leave any feedback. Thank you, hope you enjoy!

# Usage 
Users will be presented with a page of time slots ordered from 9am to 5pm, in which they can type in an event at a given time. After typing an event in a text box the user will then be able to save the event by clicking the save icon on the right hand side of the screen. Users can type and save an event for any timeblock.
